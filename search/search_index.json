You can read more cases</p> </li> <li> <p>You can prepare cases of data analysis in actual emergencies   You can prepare several cases where you analyzed data in actual emergencies   The more interesting ones are the best</p> </li> <li> <p>To test analytical skills   I think this should test the interviewer\u2019s analytical skills.   Knowledge accumulation can be achieved quickly   Coherence and sensitivity of thinking   There should also be some report writing work   There may be development and modeling work   For example, automatic analysis platform (this happens to be the educational big data analysis and application platform I work on, and it is also written on my resume)</p> </li> <li> <p>What preparations are needed in terms of analytical capabilities?   I think we just need to understand the characteristics.   For example, attack packet characteristics   Threat intelligence   There are also process abnormal characteristics   --   The most important thing is to show your coherent thinking about an event   Discover something from something   Such a derivation process is analysis</p> </li> <li> <p>You need to know something about black industry   Then we can also understand some of the methods of black production.

What is the difference between security operation and maintenance?</p> <p>It can be roughly understood as the difference between operation and operation and maintenance: Operation is the continuous operation and maintenance of the system, analyzing the operation status and generated data, finding problems and improving optimization; operation and maintenance is the release, update and maintenance of the system. Regarding security operations, you can search for the trilogy \"Careers owe money and talk about security operations\" (not this name, you have to search \"Careers owe money, security operations\", I helped him pick this name) and Nie Jun's articles on security operations.
