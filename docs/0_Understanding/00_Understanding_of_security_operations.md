# Understanding of security operations

## Compare security operations with security operations and maintenance

Operation and maintenance: In short, operation and maintenance is to ensure the normal operation of the information system, so that it can be used normally according to the design requirements, and to provide higher quality services through technical guarantee products. [2]

Security operation and maintenance = security + operation and maintenance

Operation: Operation must **continuously output value**. [2] This description is very broad, but it can well describe the overall role of operations students.

Security Operations = Security + Operations = Produce valuable security information through existing security systems and tools, and use it to solve security risks to achieve the ultimate goal of security. [2]

## Opinions of industry experts

- Jun Ge’s article "How Enterprises Build an Effective Security Operation System" [3] mentions what security operations are, and there are several points in it:

  - The means are not the ends, and safety capabilities and safety knowledge do not completely represent the safety level.

  - In most cases, companies pay for output, not for knowledge. Therefore, someone needs to analyze and diagnose the problem. After discovering the crux, coordinate resources to ultimately achieve the goal.

- Profession owes money: In order to achieve safety goals, the process of proposing safety solution ideas, verifying effects, analyzing problems, diagnosing problems, coordinating resources to solve problems, and continuing iterative optimization
- Lake2: Security personnel use security systems to formulate security policies and promote the process of resolving security risks, which is security operations.
- Qin Bo: Safety operation is the control of risks and the pursuit of a balance between safety investment returns and risks.

### Analysis from seniors

I am very grateful to Senior W for his patient answer to me. I have summarized the job requirements explained by Senior W. The main points are as follows.

- on the whole
  I think it's a broad range of emergency engineers
  But I will follow it more deeply
  This job definitely requires experience
  But since we are recruiting interns
  Then the experience requirements shouldn’t be too high.
  You can focus on demonstrating your emergency capabilities

- Mainly likely to be emergency response efforts
  In fact, I don’t do much in emergencies.
  You can read more cases

- You can prepare cases of data analysis in actual emergencies
  You can prepare several cases where you analyzed data in actual emergencies
  The more interesting ones are the best

- To test analytical skills
  I think this should test the interviewer’s analytical skills.
  Knowledge accumulation can be achieved quickly
  Coherence and sensitivity of thinking
  There should also be some report writing work
  There may be development and modeling work
  For example, **automatic analysis platform** (this happens to be the educational big data analysis and application platform I work on, and it is also written on my resume)

- What preparations are needed in terms of analytical capabilities?
  I think we just need to understand the characteristics.
  For example, attack packet characteristics
  Threat intelligence
  There are also process abnormal characteristics
  --
  The most important thing is to show your coherent thinking about an event
  Discover something from something
  Such a derivation process is analysis

- You need to know something about black industry
  Then we can also understand some of the methods of black production.
  Possible traces of black production
  Gambling
  blackmail
  Mining

### Analysis from Teacher Q

Mainly doing research on black and ash production
There are more scams on Douyin
Use an older QQ account to join many black industry groups (QQ groups to search for online earning, harvesting wool) and obtain real-time information
Douyin is a black and gray product, brushing up volume, brushing up on registrations, brushing up likes and fans, cheating in business
In terms of advertising, it was normal when uploaded, but later changed to gray and black, advertising hijacking.
Not particularly relevant to emergency response
Be very familiar with the gray and black chains
To analyze this, we need to completely restore the chain from a black and gray production clue.
In terms of cases, for example, Guo Shenghua diverted traffic from Douyin to QQ groups, sales courses, etc.
Social work skills are required

### Introduction from Master A

Master A works in Toutiao. His main advice is

> This traceability is different from the traceability of Party B’s emergency response
> Mainly anti-climbing and risk control
> Anti-climbing and tracing back to the source
> Human-machine recognition
> Cluster analysis 2. Have working experience in anti-cheating, anti-crawling and other security-related fields, and be familiar with the operation mode of black product chains and various cheating methods. Applicants with experience in risk control product operation will be given priority; 3. Have a keen eye for data, be able to accurately describe and identify cheating characteristics, and be good at discovering valuable key points from large amounts of information.
> Looking at the business, the black products of e-commerce
> There are more wool party members
> Toutiao’s main consideration is video copyright
> So crawlers are very important

### From Master L

Question: What is security operations? What is the difference between security operation and maintenance?

> It can be roughly understood as the difference between operation and operation and maintenance: Operation is the continuous operation and maintenance of the system, analyzing the operation status and generated data, finding problems and improving optimization; operation and maintenance is the release, update and maintenance of the system. Regarding security operations, you can search for the trilogy "Careers owe money and talk about security operations" (not this name, you have to search "Careers owe money, security operations", I helped him pick this name) and Nie Jun's articles on security operations. In addition, I plan to write about security operations in the next article.

Operation is the continuous operation and maintenance of the system, analysis of operation conditions and generated data, discovery of problems, improvement and optimization
